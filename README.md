 *Task 01* : Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms
 Description : This is a prediction of house prices using a Linear Regression model. I used the *California Housing* dataset, choosing key features such as income, avg.bedrooms, house age, and room details. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a model is trained to learn the relationship between features and prices. After training, I evaluated performance using *Mean Squared Error (MSE)* and visualize actual vs. predicted prices. Finally, I printed predicted house prices along with actual values.
